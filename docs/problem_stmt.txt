Idea Submission
Please note the following points as you draft your project proposal or idea submission.
The idea submission should be structured into two chapters which may have sub chapters as you may seem fit. Please note that the objective is to devise software solutions that can disrupt the insurance industry.
Cover page of the proposal should contain team name, name of the project, names of each candidate and their affiliation and contact information.

Chapter 1 (Insurance Industry Related Business Case): Business use case that you aim to satisfy. Please note all business problems that you aim to satisfy should be structured around the insurance industry. It should address at least the following points:
a) What is the problem that you aim to solve ? Please try to structure the need to solve the problem and what the solution may be worth in terms of freely available market viability evidence.
b) How long has the problem existed on the market ? Is it a traditional problem that you aim to solve or has the problem come up due to modern socio-economic and technological changes. If yes, what is the exact change that has driven the same need.
c) What would it cost to structure your software solution (average cost of product prototype) ? What would be expected maintenance cost at a assumed scale ? What would estimated value of benefits to an organization from the software solution.
Chapter 2 : Please describe how the software solution for the above business case would be structured. Please divide your software solution into sub chapters that define how each broad component of the software solution would be built. Please use uml diagrams and flow charts so that the structure of the software and algorithms proposed are easily understandable.
